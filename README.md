Overview
========
This was the final project for csci 101. I wrote a program to have the robot fol
low a trail. The trail will lead to a wall in which the robot will then need to
figure out a way to get to the place where there is no walls. Once it gets there
, there will be objects in its way. The robot will then detect the object and mo
ve away from it. It will keep on doing this until it reaches to the finish line.PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THIS PROJECT WAS DONE IN FRESHMEN YEAR.
